            If you feel like you want to take a break, or that your gaming has
            become problematic, you may voluntarily exclude yourself from the
            MetaWin platform by emailing support@metawin.com. You may request to
            exclude yourself from the MetaWin platform by choosing one of the
            following options:
          </p>
          <p>
            - Permanently’ (Permanent Self-Exclusion) selecting this option will
            exclude you from using our services indefinitely. This action cannot
            be reversed either by you or by anyone at MetaWin.
          </p>
          <p>
            - for a selected period (Limited Timeout) by informing us of the
            desired return date.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once contacted, the option chosen comes into effect within 24 hours.
            If after this you find that you can still access the MetaWin
            platform, it is your responsibility to inform us immediately via
            email.
          </p>
          <p>
            During any exclusion period, you will not have any access to the
            MetaWin platform. If you require access to your account history and
            / or information you will need to email Customer Support via email.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the conclusion of a Limited Timeout, your access to the MetaWin
            platform will be reinstated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the self-exclusion is applied and through its duration, you
            will no longer receive any further marketing materials from us. We
            strongly recommend that you also seek exclusion from all other
            gaming platforms you have an active account with. If you use social
            media channels, you should take steps to ensure that you don’t
            receive our news or updates.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may exclude you from the MetaWin platform permanently or for a
            Limited timeout period in our sole discretion if there are reasons
            to indicate that you may have a computer gaming problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is prohibited to create or access another MetaWin account while
            you're self-excluded. If you're found to do so, this can result in
            permanent bans for all your accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            MetaWin will not be held responsible for any losses or damages which
            occurred as a result of circumventing our self-exclusion program.
            Losses during this period will not be refunded.
